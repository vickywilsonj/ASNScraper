Scraping Autonomous System Numbers from http://bgp.he.net/report/world

ASNs (Autonomous System Numbers) are one of the building blocks of the
Internet. This project is to create a mapping from each ASN in use to the
company that owns it. For example, ASN 36375 is used by the University of
Michigan - http://bgp.he.net/AS36375

The site http://bgp.he.net/ has lots of useful information about ASNs. 
Starting at http://bgp.he.net/report/world crawl and scrape the linked country
reports to make a structure mapping each ASN to info about that ASN.
